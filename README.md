Practice 5 of Interactive Systems: Avatar control
I chose option 1 of exploring the fastIK asset and modifying one of the examples in the scene.
Tentacle:
Dir target: x=1 and y=1 so that the tentacle moves in a different way
Dir of pole: x=1 and y=1 so that the movement is faster
-Also I added movement in the y direction of the pole
Rotator: 
Cilinder: change the color to pink and in the script rotator I added a movement that goes from a to b and back, in this case I chose the movement to be only in the x axis, so now the cilinder translates and also rotates.
